    summary: "Singapore-listed companies have made significant progress in climate-related disclosures, according to a joint review by ACRA and SGX RegCo.",
    content: "A joint review by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) found that Singapore-listed companies have made significant progress in their climate-related disclosures. The review, which covered reports issued between January and December 2024, found that 71% of issuers had incorporated climate-related considerations into their governance frameworks, up from 56% the previous year.\n\nCompanies have also enhanced their disclosures on climate-related risks and opportunities, with 68% of issuers providing information on these aspects, compared to 49% in the previous year. This improvement demonstrates the growing recognition among Singapore companies of the importance of addressing climate change and its potential impact on their businesses.\n\nThe review highlighted that companies are increasingly adopting structured frameworks for their climate reporting, with many referencing the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. This approach helps ensure that disclosures are comparable and decision-useful for investors and other stakeholders.\n\nDespite these positive developments, the review identified areas for improvement. In particular, the quality and specificity of scenario analysis and metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities varied significantly among issuers. ACRA and SGX RegCo have encouraged companies to continue enhancing their disclosures in these areas.\n\n\"Climate reporting is still evolving globally, and we are encouraged by the progress made by Singapore issuers,\" said a spokesperson for ACRA. \"We will continue to work with the industry to raise the standard of climate-related disclosures in Singapore.\"\n\nSGX RegCo has announced plans to organize workshops and provide additional guidance to help companies improve their climate reporting practices.",

    title: "New ESG Requirements for Singapore Listed Companies: What You Need to Know",
    slug: "new-esg-requirements-for-singapore-listed-companies",
    summary: "Singapore's regulators have introduced new ESG reporting requirements for listed companies, focusing on sustainability metrics and climate risk disclosures.",
    content: "Singapore's regulators have introduced enhanced Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting requirements for listed companies. These new requirements, which will be phased in over the next two years, aim to improve the quality and comparability of sustainability disclosures in the Singapore market.\n\nThe new rules require companies to report on a broader range of sustainability metrics and provide more detailed information on their climate-related risks and opportunities. Companies will also need to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and set targets for reducing them.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the requirement for companies to include sustainability information in their annual reports, rather than publishing separate sustainability reports. This change is designed to ensure that ESG information is given the same importance as financial information.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) has emphasized that these new requirements are aligned with international standards, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards.\n\n\"These enhanced reporting requirements will help investors make more informed decisions and drive capital towards more sustainable businesses,\" said the Chief Executive Officer of SGX RegCo. \"They will also help companies identify and manage their ESG risks more effectively.\"\n\nTo help companies comply with the new requirements, SGX has published a detailed guide that explains the new rules and provides examples of good reporting practices. The exchange has also organized a series of workshops to help companies understand the new requirements and improve their reporting practices.\n\nCompanies are advised to start preparing for these new requirements early, as they may need to implement new data collection and reporting systems to meet the more detailed disclosure expectations.",
